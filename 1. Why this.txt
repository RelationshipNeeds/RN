Why This?
<h2> When Relationships Thrive, Faith Communities Flourish</h2>
<p>We look to our faith communities for connection, belonging, and support—especially when our personal relationships feel strained. But when couples and families struggle silently, or when community relationships fray, the very place we count on for healing can begin to feel distant, divided, or unwelcoming.</p>

Why Now?
<h2>We’re Longing for Better Connection—but Lacking the Language</h2>
<p>Faith communities everywhere are feeling the pressure of quiet—*or loud*—disconnection. Marriages and close relationships are under strain. Parents feel overwhelmed and unsupported. Within the community, unresolved interpersonal tensions can block warmth and belonging. We’re doing our best to love and accept one another—but without a shared language for what we really need, we often fall short.</p>

Why This Solution?
<h2>Faith + Science: A Powerful Path to Deeper Connection</h2>
<p>We’re taught to love others, avoid judgment, and speak with kindness. But in real life, relationships often break down over what seem like the smallest things. It’s clear we all judge each other’s behavior through different filters. Until now, it hasn’t been clear why.</p>

<p>In the late 1940s, Roger Birkman made a breakthrough discovery. He found that each of us has 10 Behavioral Needs that shape how we see and respond to others. The very same behavior that feels right to one person can upset another.</p>

<p>This powerful insight helps explain why so many good people misunderstand each other. It’s the hidden source of judgment—and a gift to every faith community ready to love more wisely.</p>
